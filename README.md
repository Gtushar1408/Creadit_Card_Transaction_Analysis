Credit Card Transaction Analysis Queries:-
This document provides an overview of the SQL queries used to perform credit card transaction analysis. The queries analyse a dataset named "credit_card_transcations," which contains information about credit card transactions, including transaction amount, card type, city, gender, and expense type.
Top 5 Cities with Highest Spends and Their Percentage Contribution: This query identifies the top 5 cities with the highest total credit card spends and calculates their percentage contribution to the overall total credit card spends. The result includes columns for city name, total amount spent (t_a), and percentage contribution (perc).
Highest Spend Month and Amount for Each Card Type: This query determines the highest spend month and the amount spent in that month for each card type. The result includes columns for card type, total spend (t_spend), month, and year.
Transaction Details for Each Card Type When Cumulative Spends Reach 1000000: This query retrieves all transaction details for each card type when the cumulative total spends for that card type reach or exceed 1000000. The output will have four rows, one for each card type.
City with Lowest Percentage Spend for Gold Card Type: The query identifies the city with the lowest percentage spend for the "Gold" card type. The result includes the city name, card type, total spend (t_sum), and the percentage spend for Gold cards.
City, Highest Expense Type, and Lowest Expense Type: This query prints three columns: city, highest_expense_type, and lowest_expense_type. It finds the highest and lowest expense types for each city based on the total amount spent.
Percentage Contribution of Spends by Females for Each Expense Type: The query calculates the percentage contribution of credit card spends made by females for each expense type. The result includes columns for expense type, gender, total spend by females (t_s), total spend for the expense type (t_a), and the percentage contribution (f_c_s).
Card and Expense Type Combination with Highest Month-over-Month Growth in Jan-2014: This query identifies the card and expense type combination that saw the highest month-over-month growth in January 2014. The result includes the card type, expense type, total spend in January 2014 (t_s), total spend in the previous month (l_s), and the month-over-month growth (mom).
Query 8 appears to be missing from the provided list.
City with the Highest Total Spend to Total Number of Transactions Ratio during Weekends: This query determines which city has the highest total spend to total number of transactions ratio during weekends (Saturday and Sunday). The result includes the city name, total spend (t_a), total number of transactions (c), and the ratio of total spend to total transactions.
City with the Least Number of Days to Reach 500th Transaction after the First Transaction: The final query finds the city that took the least number of days to reach its 500th transaction after the first transaction in that city. The result includes the city name, date of the first transaction, date of the 500th transaction, and the number of days taken to reach the 500th transaction.
Note: These queries assume a dataset named "credit_card_transcations" and are specifically designed for this dataset's schema. Make sure to adjust the queries if the dataset structure or column names differ.
It is essential to have appropriate indexing on the dataset's columns to optimize the query performance, especially for large datasets. Additionally, these queries are written for SQL databases, and the compatibility should be checked if using them with other database systems.
