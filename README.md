 Credit Card Transaction Analysis Queries:

it is an overview of SQL queries designed to analyze credit card transactions stored in a dataset named "credit_card_transactions." The dataset contains information on transaction amount, card type, city, gender, and expense type.


The first query identifies the top 5 cities with the highest credit card spends and calculates their percentage contribution to the total spends. The second query determines the highest spend month and amount for each card type. The third query retrieves transaction details for each card type when cumulative spends reach or exceed 1000000.


The fourth query finds the city with the lowest percentage spend for "Gold" card type. The fifth query lists the city, highest, and lowest expense types for each city based on total amount spent. The sixth query calculates the percentage contribution of credit card spends made by females for each expense type.


The seventh query identifies the card and expense type combination with the highest month-over-month growth in January 2014. Query 8 is missing from the list. The ninth query determines the city with the highest total spend to total number of transactions ratio during weekends.


The final query finds the city that took the least number of days to reach its 500th transaction after the first transaction. Note that these queries are optimized for the specific dataset's schema and may require adjustments for datasets with different structures or column names. Appropriate indexing is essential for optimal query performance, particularly for large datasets. Compatibility should be checked when using these queries with different database systems.
